# StructuralForms
This is a desktop application for shape and parameter optimization of trusses. 
It features a GUI for designing the truss structure, setting up the optimization problem and displaying the results.

Optimization criteria: 1) Minimization of total mass or 2) Minimization of external work

Constraints: total mass, external work, maximum stress, range of eigenfrequencies

The optimization is performed with the Differential Evolution algorithm: http://www1.icsi.berkeley.edu/~storn/code.html
